Create a program to print the occurrence of a character in the string.

Take string input and store it in the string1 variable.
Take a character input (a string with a single character) and store it in character1 variable.
Create a variable named count and initialize it to 0.
Use a for loop to iterate through string1.
Inside the loop, check the occurrence of the character in the string. If it's True, increment count by 1.
Print the count variable.
Assumption: We will assume the user will first enter a string and then a single character.


# take string input for string1
string1 = input()
l = list(string1)

# take character input for character1
character1 = input()

count = 0
count = l.count(character1)
    # check if character is present in the string or not
if character1 in l:
    print(count)
else:
    print(0)
